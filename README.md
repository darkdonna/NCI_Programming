# E-commerce Data Analysis

## Project Description

This project involves an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a real-world e-commerce dataset from a company (referred to as “Company X”) that sells digital products, specifically website themes for WooCommerce and BigCommerce platforms. The dataset covers sales data over a period of 3 months. The analysis aims to provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and strategies for enhancing revenue.

### Objectives

1. **Sales Performance Overview and Forecasting:**
   - Analyze current sales performance and forecast future trends for the next period.
   - "Company X" has been selling digital products for nearly 10 years. The goal is to uncover insights on orders and revenue performance and provide forecasts using simple trend-based forecasting techniques.

2. **Weekly Sales Performance Patterns:**
   - Evaluate sales performance across different days of the week to determine if certain days generate more or fewer sales and revenue.
   - A Chi-square test will be applied to determine if observed patterns occur by chance or reflect underlying sales trends.

3. **Geographical Sales Analysis:**
   - Analyze sales performance by geography to identify the best-performing countries.
   - Insights into regional profitability will help "Company X" prioritize marketing efforts and optimize their strategy for regions with higher sales and conversion rates.

4. **New Subscriptions vs. Renewals Analysis:**
   - Assess trends in new customer acquisitions versus subscription renewals.
   - Understand whether growth is driven by gaining new customers or retaining existing subscribers.

5. **Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis:**
   - Develop a customer segmentation model based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) value.
   - Identify the most valuable customers and understand their purchase behavior, which can be used to predict future purchases and enhance customer retention strategies.

6. **Split Test Evaluation for Discount Strategies:**
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of two different discount tiers ($50 and $60) offered to randomly split customer groups during the analysis period.
   - Conduct a t-test for two independent groups to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in sales performance between the discount groups.

## Methodology

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** EDA, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Sales Analysis:** Sales data was analyzed for overall performance, weekly patterns, and geographic trends.
- **RFM Customer Segmentation:** Customers were segmented based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value using RFM analysis.
- **Statistical Tests:** Chi-square test for weekly sales patterns and a t-test for evaluating discount strategy effectiveness.

## Conclusion

This project aims to provide "Company X" with actionable insights on sales performance, customer behavior, and effective marketing strategies. By leveraging data-driven techniques, "Company X" can optimize their business strategies, improve customer retention, and increase overall revenue.
